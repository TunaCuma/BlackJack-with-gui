# BlackJack with gui
A blackjack game i made for cs101 class.

The GUI code was written by https://github.com/uzaymacar but was adapted for this lab by E. Batuhan Kaynak and modified a little bit by me (i added choosing hit or stand on pop ups instead of choosing on logs).

# Sample Game:

we can stop drawing cards if we think it is enough and make it dealers turn.

we get pop ups like this when we win or lose.
